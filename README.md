## Features

### 🚿 Adaptive Watering
- Track watering intervals per plant
- **Adaptive & customizable interval reduction** — if you consistently water early, the interval automatically shortens
- **Adaptive & customizable interval extension** — if you consistently snooze watering, the interval automatically lengthens
- Snooze watering by one day without resetting the period
- Sensors show human-readable status: `Today`, `In 3 Days`, `2 Days Overdue`

### 🌿 Plant Health
- Health select entity: `Excellent`, `Good`, `Poor`, `Sick`
- Configurable reminder notifications if health hasn't been checked recently
- **Confirm Health** button — press to confirm you've checked on your plant without needing to change the health value. Resets the check-in clock.

### 🧪 Fertilization (optional)
- Track fertilization on a separate interval
- Same sensor pattern as watering
- Snoozing watering also snoozes fertilization if it is due the same day
- Can be enabled on any plant after setup via Configure — you'll be prompted for the last fertilized date when first enabled
- When enabling fertilization on an existing plant via Configure, reload the
entry/plant afterwards (**Settings → Devices & Services → Adaptive Plant →⋮ → Reload**) to create the fertilization entities. Once reloaded, open Configure again to set your desired interval — the Fertilization interval field appears once fertilization is active. Then press **Mark fertilized** once for the interval to take effect and for Days until fertilization to calculate correctly.

### 🪴 Repotting (optional)
- Track when a plant was last repotted via the **Last repotted** date sensor
- **Mark repotted** button stamps today's date as the last repotting event
- **Repotted on** text field — enter a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. `2026-04-01`) before pressing Mark repotted to record a past date instead of today. The field clears automatically after the button is pressed.
- Can be enabled on any plant after setup via Configure — you'll be prompted for the last repotted date when first enabled

> **Note:** The **Repotted on** field accepts dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format only (e.g. `2026-04-01`). Invalid entries are ignored and Mark repotted will fall back to today's date.

### 💧 Moisture Sensor Integration (optional)
- Link any existing sensor entity
- Automatically reschedule watering if soil is dry
- Automatically mark as watered if soil is saturated
- Adaptive watering logic is disabled for moisture sensor plants — the sensor drives watering decisions, the schedule acts as a fallback only
- Moisture sensor, dry threshold, and wet threshold can all be added, changed, or removed after setup via Configure. Use the Enable moisture sensor toggle to remove a sensor — toggling off clears the sensor and both thresholds.

> **Tip:** To remove a moisture sensor after setup, open Configure, toggle Enable moisture sensor off, and save. (The moisture sensor uses Home Assistant's entity picker, which can't be cleared by deleting the value — the toggle is the supported way to remove it.)

### 📝 Notes (optional)
- Free-form text field stored per plant
- Can be enabled or disabled at any time via Configure — no restart required

### 📖 Care Instructions (optional)
- Store longer, free-form care guidance per plant — light, watering, soil, feeding,
  repotting tips, whatever you've gathered for that species
- Handles long, multi-line text — where **Notes** is meant for short jottings,
  Care Instructions is for full write-ups
- Basic formatting: wrap text in `**double asterisks**` for bold headings, and
  line breaks are preserved
- Edited in the integration's settings (**Configure**) and shown read-only in the
  expanded plant detail on the companion card's Overview tab
- Enable or disable per plant at any time via Configure — no restart required

> **Tip:** Adaptive Plant won't tell you *how* to care for a plant (see the [FAQ](#-faq))
> — Care Instructions is simply where you record the guidance *you've* gathered, so it's
> on hand right next to the plant.

### 🖼️ Plant Image (optional)
- Attach a `/local/` image path to display on dashboard cards. Can be changed via configuration after entry is created. I recommend creating a folder titled 'adaptive_plant' in your `/www/` folder and uploading your plant images there.
> **Example image pathway (w/ folder created) for card config:**  `/local/adaptive_plant/monstera.png`

> **Example image pathway (without folder, uploaded directly into `/www/`) for card config:**  `/local/monstera.png`
- Image **size** (px) and **shape** (circle / square, softly rounded) are configurable on the companion card via the visual editor or YAML. Set `image_size: 0` to hide plant photos entirely for clean text-only rows. The health ring follows the chosen shape.


### 🏠 Area & Label Support
- Assign each plant to a Home Assistant area during setup
- Optionally add a **label** (e.g. `Left shelf`, `Window sill`) to group plants within an area
- Labels can be added, changed, or removed at any time via the integration's settings
- Unlabelled plants always appear first within their area

### 🔬 Latin Name (optional)
- Store the scientific name for each plant
- Enabled or disabled per plant during setup or via Configure at any time
- Displayed on the companion card below the plant name (if enabled)

|--------|------|-------------|
| Last watered | Sensor | Date of last watering |
| Next watering | Sensor | Scheduled next watering date |
| Days until watering | Sensor | Human-readable countdown |
| Early watering count | Sensor | Diagnostic — consecutive periods watered early |
| Consecutive periods snoozed | Sensor | Diagnostic — consecutive periods snoozed before watering |
| Health | Select | Excellent / Good / Poor / Sick |
| Watering interval | Number | Editable interval in days |
| Mark watered | Button | Records watering, applies adaptive logic |
| Snooze today's tasks | Button | Delays watering (and fertilization if also due) by 1 day |
| Confirm health | Button | Resets the health check-in clock without changing the health value |
| Last fertilized | Sensor | *(if fertilization enabled)* |
| Next fertilization | Sensor | *(if fertilization enabled)* |
| Days until fertilization | Sensor | *(if fertilization enabled)* |
| Fertilization interval | Number | *(if fertilization enabled)* |
| Mark fertilized | Button | *(if fertilization enabled)* |
| Last repotted | Sensor | *(if repotting enabled)* |
| Mark repotted | Button | *(if repotting enabled)* Stamps today's date, or the date in the Repotted on field if set |
| Repotted on | Text | *(if repotting enabled)* Enter a past date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format before pressing Mark repotted |
| Notes | Text | *(if notes enabled)* |
| Latin name | Text | *(if latin name enabled)* |
| Soil moisture | Sensor | Diagnostic — live reading from linked moisture sensor *(if moisture sensor configured)* |

## Adaptive Logic

### Watering interval reduction
If you press **Mark Watered** before the scheduled date, an early watering counter increments. Once it reaches the configured threshold, the watering interval is reduced by 1 day (minimum 1). The counter resets if you water on time.
> **Example:** If you notice a plant that has a 7 day watering interval is dry prior to its set watering date (7th day since last watering) -> you water it early repeatedly (marking the watering each time) -> once it hits the threshold you entered on set-up the watering period is decreased by a day.

### Watering interval extension
If you press **Snooze today's tasks** when a watering is due, a snooze streak counter increments and the task is pushed to tomorrow. Once it the snooze count reaches the configured threshold across consecutive periods, the watering interval increases by 1 day (maximum 365). The streak resets if you water without snoozing.
> **Example:** If you notice a plant that has a 7 day watering interval is not in need of watering on its due date -> you snooze the task until the soil is adequately dry -> if this pattern repeats across enough consecutive watering periods to hit the configured threshold, the watering interval is extended by a day to better match the plant's actual needs.

> **Note:** Snoozing and then watering the same plant on the same day will count that period as both early and snoozed. This is a known edge case and _may_ be addressed in a future release. In the meantime.... don't do that? Why would you do that?

## 🃏 Companion Lovelace Card

This repo includes a companion Lovelace card (`adaptive-plant-card.js`) with a full visual editor, designed specifically for use with this integration.

### Card Installation

The card is bundled with the integration and registered automatically as a Lovelace resource when the integration loads — no manual installation required. The integration registers a single HTTP endpoint to serve the card file, which is what enables this automatic registration.

Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) after installing or updating.

> **Upgrading from v1.1.0 or earlier?** Previous versions required manually copying `www/adaptive-plant-card.js` to your HA `config/www/` directory and adding it as a resource under **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**. Remove that old resource entry to avoid the card loading twice.

### Card Features

- **Today tab** — plants due or overdue, grouped by area and label. Mark watered, mark fertilized, or snooze directly from the card. Hold the button at the bottom to complete all tasks at once. The snooze button remains visible until all of a plant's tasks for the day are resolved.
- **Upcoming tab** — future waterings and fertilizations with a configurable day cutoff. Plants with both tasks due on the same day appear as a single combined row. Mark tasks early directly from the card.
- **Overview tab** — all plants grouped by area and label, with a configurable sort order (alphabetical, health, or days until watering). Expand any plant to see next watering/fertilization dates, edit health, add notes, view care instructions, confirm health check-in, and mark tasks complete.
- **Labels** — plants with a label assigned are grouped under a sublabel header within their area, across all tabs
- **Health ring** — colored ring around each plant avatar indicating health status, configurable per tab
- **Confirm Health button** — always visible in the Overview expanded detail. Shows a heart icon and reads "Update Due" when a health check-in is overdue. Color configurable.
- **Repotting** — Mark Repotted button and date input in the expanded detail view on the overview tab, with customizable button color and icon. The button and input can be hidden via the visual editor or `show_repotting` — the last repotted date always remains visible.
- **Latin / scientific name** — displays in italics below the plant name across all three tabs when enabled on a plant. Font size, color, and vertical padding all configurable.
- **Transparent background** — option to hide the card background, compatible with frosted glass themes
- **Pin hold button** — optionally fix the "Hold to complete all" button to the bottom of the card
- **Full visual editor** — configure everything without writing YAML


### Card Configuration & Visual Editor

The card is fully configurable via the visual editor — no YAML required. The card can be modified via YAML if that is your preference (scroll down).

**Default configuration - no options set (all 3 tabs shown for visual reference. They are displayed one at a time by the card.):**
<img width="2912" height="1768" alt="BIG(21)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/860cf243-4a54-4e28-babe-01d823e238d5" />



```yaml
type: custom:adaptive-plant-card
```

**Custom palette — deep blue-gray background, muted sage tabs, warm amber area headers and copper label sub-headers. Max height set, latin name enabled, centered labels, pinned hold button:**

<img width="2912" height="1521" alt="BIG(22)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21cf4cb7-d1de-431d-898c-4c88fe429ded" />

## 📋 Task Reminder Blueprint

A companion blueprint for daily plant task reminders is bundled with the integration and copied automatically into your HA blueprints directory when the integration loads — find it under Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints without any manual import needed.

Sends a single combined notification when any of your plants have watering or fertilization tasks due or overdue — automatically discovering all plants without any manual configuration. Supports up to three daily reminder times, customizable notification text, an optional task count summary (e.g. "4 Waterings and 2 Fertilizations"), and a tap action to open your plant dashboard directly. Optionally restrict notifications to only fire when a person is in a specific zone. Plants can be individually excluded from watering or fertilization reminders. Compatible with the Home Assistant Companion App (iOS and Android).

> **Upgrading from v1.1.0 or earlier?** The blueprint was previously available at `blueprints/automation/adaptive_plant/plant_task_reminders.yaml` in the repo root and required manual import. It can still be imported manually from that path on those versions. From v1.2.0 onwards it is bundled and copied automatically.

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Big-Xan/adaptive_plant/main/custom_components/adaptive_plant/blueprints/automation/plant_task_reminders.yaml)

Or manually import via **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints → Import Blueprint** and paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Big-Xan/adaptive_plant/main/custom_components/adaptive_plant/blueprints/automation/plant_task_reminders.yaml

## ❓ FAQ

**Does Adaptive Plant tell me how to take care of my plants?**

No — and that's by design. Adaptive Plant tracks and adapts to *your*
care routine rather than prescribing one. It learns your plant's actual
needs over time based on how you interact with it ("oh the soil is still wet I need to snooze it again."), but it won't tell you
that a Monstera wants indirect light or that succulents need to dry out
completely between waterings.

A plant's watering needs are influenced by a wide range of factors —
potting mix, pot size, pot type (terracotta vs. plastic vs. ceramic),
distance from the window, window direction, season, humidity, and more.
For species-specific guidance, the best starting points are:

- Houseplant subreddits (r/houseplants, r/plantclinic, and many
  species-specific communities)
- A targeted Google search for your plant's latin name
- AI assistants — just be sure to include context like potting mix,
  pot size and type, distance from window, and window direction for
  the most accurate advice

Once you have a rough watering cadence, set it as your starting interval
and let Adaptive Plant tune it from there.

---

**How do I get the tablet layout shown in the screenshot?**

Three separate cards placed side by side, each showing only one tab
(Today, Upcoming, and Overview respectively), sized to fit the tablet
screen exactly. To replicate it:

- Add three Adaptive Plant cards to a horizontal stack or grid layout
- On each card, disable the two tabs you don't want:
```yaml
  # Card 1 — Today only
  type: custom:adaptive-plant-card
  show_upcoming: false
  show_overview: false

  # Card 2 — Upcoming only
  type: custom:adaptive-plant-card
  show_today: false
  show_overview: false

  # Card 3 — Overview only
  type: custom:adaptive-plant-card
  show_today: false
  show_upcoming: false
```
- Set a `height` on each card to fill your screen and adjust widths
  to taste

---

**Can I use this without the companion card?**

Yes — the card is entirely optional. Every entity the integration creates
is a standard HA entity and works with any dashboard setup. You can use
generic HA cards like `entity`, `button`, or `history-graph` — whatever
fits your existing dashboard. The companion card just gives you a
purpose-built view with all your plants in one place, adaptive logic
visualized, and one-tap actions. The integration has no dependency on
the card.

---

**What happens if I delete a plant and re-add it?**

All state is stored in the config entry — last watered date, next
watering, fertilization dates, repotting history, notes, care instructions,
health, and the adapted watering interval. Deleting the entry permanently deletes all of
that. Re-adding the plant starts completely fresh.

If you need to change a setting, always use **Configure** rather than
deleting and re-adding — almost everything is editable after setup
without losing any data.

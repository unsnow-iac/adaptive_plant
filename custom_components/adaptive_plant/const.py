# ── Uploaded-image ownership ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Uploaded photos are saved as a uuid4 hex + ".jpg" (see _save_uploaded_image in
# config_flow.py). Owned-file detection matches that exact shape — the folder
# prefix AND a 32-char hex filename — so an image a user hand-places in the same
# /www/adaptive_plant/ folder (e.g. /local/adaptive_plant/monstera.png) is never
# treated as ours and is never auto-deleted on re-upload, disable, or removal.
